        <h1>Fighting against deforestation and illegal logging</h1>
        <p>
            Among the most significant natural resources, trees rank first in importance as a component of the ecosystem. 
            It is estimated that forests encompass 30% of the earth's land surface area. 
            Carbon dioxide is absorbed and oxygen is produced by these forest regions. 
            Tress is a rich source of medicine, food, fuel, and a variety of other resources, 
            among other resources. The forest also aids in the filtration and retention of water in the soil. 
            Trees benefit the environment by supplying oxygen, improving air quality, 
            reducing climate change, saving water, protecting soil, and providing habitat for wildlife. 
            Nowadays, individuals are illegally down trees for their personal benefit. 
            These illegal activities are the major reason for tree extinction. 
            When we look at deforestation in Sri Lanka, we see reports of increased deforestation and illegal commercial or developmental projects in a variety of field. 
            Since then, the subject has grown linked to politics and particular political individuals. 
            Due to a lack of governmental power, the blame game has progressed. 
            Recent discussions have centered on the deforestation of Wanathawillu, Anawilundawa, 
            and Sinharaja.
        </p>     
        <p>
            According to researchers, Sri Lanka had about 82 percent forest cover 
            in 1882. On average, we lost 26,800 hectares. Between 1990 and 2000, the annual 
            rate of forest loss was 1.14 percent. Between 1990 and 2005, Sri Lanka's forest 
            cover decreased by 17.7 percentage points.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2010, the world's tree cover covered 3.92 billion hectares (Gha), 
            covering more than 30 percent of its geographical surface. 
            It is expected to lose 25.8 million hectares of forest cover by 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
            Deforestation has been recognized as a serious concern around the globe as a result of illicit logging. 
            This has a significant global impact. It will be better able to safeguard those trees and decrease deforestation if we can figure out at what time, 
            when and when people perform these sorts of illegal activities. The fact that people 
            are unaware of this information is one of the major reasons why illegal tree cutting 
            is so difficult to stop.
