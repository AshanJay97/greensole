                        Trees are the most important natural resource since they are a part of the ecosystem. 
                        Forests are estimated to cover 30 percent of the planet's surface area. They absorb carbon 
                        dioxide and create oxygen in the process. As well as its many other benefits, tress is a 
                        valuable source of medicine, food, and fuel. Additionally, the forest assists in the filtration 
                        and retention of water inside the soil.
                       </p>
                        
                       <p>
                        Nowadays, people are cutting down trees for their own profit. These illegal activities are the 
                        major reason for tree loss. When we look at deforestation in Sri Lanka, we observe allegations 
                        of increased deforestation and illegal commercial or developmental operations in a range of sectors. 
                        Since then, the issue has become tied to politics and specific political figures. Due to a lack of 
                        political authority, the blame game has advanced. Recent talks have focused on the deforestation of 
                        Wanathawillu, Anawilundawa, and Sinharaja.
